# Welcome to the Mission

In this mission, you will learn how to enrich a Kyma based multitenant application with new identity features. It is related to the mission [Develop a Multitenant Extension Application in SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3683/3726/) and extends it by focusing on identity topics like identity management via SAP Identity Services, custom identity provider and principal propagation.

As a result, in this mission everything will be based on the multitenant application called Easy Franchise, which is a multitenant application running on the Kyma environment of the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) extending SAP S/4HANA Cloud. We highly recommend you to have a look at the above mentioned mission where you can find there all the necessary details. Therefore be aware that we will not spend so much time here on explaining the application. We will rather focus on enriching it with new features.

For a sake of simplicity, our team has taken some compromise compared to a real application. So, this application doesn't aim to be used for productive usage.

Here is an overview diagram of the EasyFranchise application:

## Who Is This Mission For?

The business scenario of this tutorial has been created with the partner as focus persona. But this is of course not exclusively relevant for SAP partners and can be useful for every person looking for details on how to enrich a multitenant application running on Kyma with new identity features. 
As mentioned before, we highly recommend to start with the mission [Develop a Multitenant Extension Application in SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3683/3726/) as we are expecting some knowledge (e.g. Kyma, SAP BTP, ...) to run this mission focusing on identity. As we are concentrating us here on advanced topics, this mission is mainly suitable for experienced developers on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).

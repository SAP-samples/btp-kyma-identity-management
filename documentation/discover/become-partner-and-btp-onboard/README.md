# Become an SAP Partner and Onboard to SAP BTP

To become an SAP partner, you have to fulfill the prerequisites to be able to develop, publish, market a solution on SAP BTP, and sell and deploy this solution to your customers.

For new SAP partners, apply online at [sap.com](https://www.sap.com/partner/become.html).

Join SAP PartnerEdge Open Ecosystem, register for PartnerEdge Build, submit a solution for Application Readiness Check (ARC) and complete the Due Diligence.

Partners must complete and return their PartnerEdge agreement (via digital signature) and the PartnerEdge program fee must be received before a partner is onboarded.

Existing SAP partners can request additional partner types via **Manage My Partnership**. Check the following links:

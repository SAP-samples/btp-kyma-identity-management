# Configure a Custom Identity Provider
So far, we have replaced the usage of SAP Authorization and Trust Management service with SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication to manage user authentication.  In this chapter we will demostrate how to use a custom identity provider to centrally manage user authentication and authorization in the custom identity provider. 

## Prerequisites 
You already have a custom identity provider. In this mission we will use Microsoft Azure Active Directory.

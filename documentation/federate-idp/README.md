# Configure a Custom Identity Provider
So far, we have replaced the usage of SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service with SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication to manage the customer users. Now, we go further and we assume that the customer has its own identity provider and we want to federate it by using Indentity Authentication as a proxy.
In this chapter, we will explain the different steps to implement it.

In this chapter, you will learn:

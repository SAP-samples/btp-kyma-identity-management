# Configure the Identity Authentication Service

Before starting with more detailled tasks, we want to update the existing application by using the identity provider of the customer City Scooter. So far, the existing Easy Franchise application has been using the [SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/authorization-and-trust-management-service/?region=all). We want now to replace it with [SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/identity-authentication/?region=all).

In this chapter, you will:

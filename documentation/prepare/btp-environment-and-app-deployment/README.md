# Set Up your SAP BTP Environment and Deploy the Easy Franchise Application

In order to run this mission, you need the Easy Franchise application as we will use it as basis and extend it with new features.
You have 2 different options to get it ready:

* Manual approach

  Go through the [Develop a Multitenant Extension Application in SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3683/3726/) mission step by step and you will have at the end everything you need.

* Automated approach

  We make use of the [btp-setup-automator](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-setup-automator) to configure the SAP BTP environment needed for the mission. You can find the instructions how to prepare the account in the [btp-setup-automator use case for our mission](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-setup-automator/blob/main/usecases/released/discoverycenter/3999-kyma-day2-operations/README.md).

Once the account has been setup, you need to prepare the customer subaccount before you can get started. This will be explained in the next chapter.

# Set Up Your SAP BTP Environment

We make use of the [btp-setup-automator](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-setup-automator) to configure the SAP BTP environment needed for the mission. You can find the instructions how to prepare the account in the [btp-setup-automator use case for our mission](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-setup-automator/tree/main/usecases/released/discoverycenter/4000-kyma-identity-management).

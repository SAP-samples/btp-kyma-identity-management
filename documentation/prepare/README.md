# Prepare

In order to run this mission, you need the application Easy Franchise as we will use it as basis and extend it with new features.
You have 2 different options to get it ready:

* Manual approach

  Go through the [Develop a Multitenant Extension Application in SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3683/3726/) mission step by step and you will have at the end everything you need.

* Automated approach

  You use the prepared scripts in this mission to configure your SAP BTP environment and to deploy the application Easy Franchise. 

In this optional chapter, we are focusing on the second option. These are the scripts we are using:
* [Set-up Your SAP BTP Environment](./btp-environment/README.md)
* [Deploy the Easy Franchise Application](./deploy-app/README.md)

# Prepare

In order to run this mission, you need the Easy Franchise application as we will use it as basis and extend it with new features.
You have 2 different options to get it ready:

* Manual approach

  Go through the [Develop a Multitenant Extension Application in SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3683/3726/) mission step by step and you will have at the end everything you need.

* Automated approach

  We make use of the [btp-setup-automator](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-setup-automator) to configure the SAP BTP environment needed for the mission. You can find the instructions how to prepare the account in the [btp-setup-automator use case for our mission](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-setup-automator/tree/main/usecases/released/discoverycenter/4000-kyma-identity-management).

  After the account has been setup you need to perform some final configuration before you can get started:

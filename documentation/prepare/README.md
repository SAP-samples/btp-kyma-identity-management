# Prepare

In order to run this mission, you need the Easy Franchise application as we will use it as basis and extend it with new features.
You have 2 different options to get it ready:

* Manual approach

  Go through the [Develop a Multitenant Extension Application in SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3683/3726/) mission step by step and you will have at the end everything you need.

* Automated approach

  Use the prepared scripts in this mission to configure your SAP BTP environment and to deploy the Easy Franchise application. 

In this optional chapter, we are focusing on the second option. Here are the steps needed to have everything set up:
1. [Set-up your SAP BTP Environment and Deploy the Easy Franchise Application](./prepare/btp-environment-and-app-deployment/README.md)
